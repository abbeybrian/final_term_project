### Purpose of the project
There are many machine learning tools for classification in scikit learn library. In this project, I found the best model for classification problem. In the process of comparing the accuracy of the models, I finally used Linear Discriminant Anlaysis model which gave me the highest accuracy. In the code, there are some explanation of the dataset for face recognition, hyperparameter tuning procedures, and the accuracy of the model.
